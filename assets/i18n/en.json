It also contains the richest springs in sulfur in the world, in addition to containing other healing minerals such as sodium carbonate and some metallic elements; such as magnesium and iron. Water resources for medical purposes are characterized by containing a salinity ratio suitable for healing processes. Natural wells with fresh and drinkable water are also widespread in Egypt. The state has invested in and used them for economic purposes with strict control over specifications and standards; to ensure the quality and purity of water from impurities and germs and the degree of hardness of the water and its chemical composition. Egypt contains sand dunes whose therapeutic importance is equal to the importance of mineral water; as the sands in them contain a group of radioactive elements that are beneficial for treating rheumatic diseases and diseases resulting from diseases of the spine and other diseases with severe pain; where they are used These dunes are buried in the body or the part of the body that is suffering from acute pain for specific and studied periods of time.",
